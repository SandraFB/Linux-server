*Setting up a repository*

This **tutorial provides an overview of how to set up a repository (repo)** under Git version control. This resource will walk you through initializing a Git repository for a new or existing project. Included below are workflow examples of repositories both created locally and cloned from remote repositories. This guide assumes a basic familiarity with a command-line interface.

The high level points this guide will cover are:

- Initializing a new Git repo
- Cloning an existing Git repo
- Committing a modified version of a file to the repo
- Configuring a Git repo for remote collaboration
- Common Git version control commands

By the end of this module, you should be able to create a Git repo, use common Git commands, commit a modified file, view your projectâ€™s history and configure a connection to a Git hosting service (Bitbucket).
